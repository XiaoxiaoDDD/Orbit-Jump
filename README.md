# Orbit-Jump
a spanceship is revolving around a planet. Once the player hit the keyboard,
the propeller will push the spaceship along the tangent line, aiming at the target planet.
If the spaceship miss the orbit of the next planet, the player loses. 
Else, it would jump to the next orbit and continue revolving around it.
Some planets have special features,i.e. the size of the orbit/the velocity of revolving.
Once the spaceship arrives at the final planet, the player wins.
